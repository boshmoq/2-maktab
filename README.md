# 2-Maktab Website
This was my **first big project**, built back in **2021**, when I decided my school deserved a website with a heartbeat and I was determined to craft it myself.

## 🌱 About the Project
The **2-Maktab Website** was created as a digital home for my school.  
It was my first real dive into web development — the project where curiosity turned into code and code turned into something people could actually click on.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Back then I was just entering the world of development, so I used what every young builder starts with:
- **HTML** – the skeleton  
- **CSS** – the style  
- **JavaScript** – the sparks of interaction  

(If you used anything else, tell me - I’ll update it.)

---
## 🌟 Features
- Clean and simple interface  
- Pages for school info, announcements, contacts  
- Fully built and maintained by a student  (formerly)

---
## ✨ Why It Matters
This project wasn’t just a website, it was the moment I realized I *could* create things that live on the internet.  
A starting point. The first brick on a much bigger road.
